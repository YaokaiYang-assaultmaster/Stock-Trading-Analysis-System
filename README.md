## Run the `data-producer.py` code

1. Set up a zookeeper server in docker container

```
docker run -d -p 2181:2181 -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888 --name zookeeper confluent/zookeeper
```

2. Set up a Kafka server in docker container

```
docker run -d -p 9092:9092 -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=localhost -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT=9092 --name kafka --link zookeeper:zookeeper confluent/kafka
```

3. Set up a Zipkin server in docker container (for tracing)

```
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 --name zipkin openzipkin/zipkin
```

4. Now we can run the data-producer.py with following command

```
python data-producer.py GOOGL stock-price localhost:9092
```

At this point, we could also see program at from `http://localhost:9411`, which is generated by Zipkin. 

> Notice that there could be an error like following:

> ```
> WARNING:apscheduler.scheduler:Execution of job "fetch_price (trigger: interval[0:00:01], next run at: 2017-04-28 01:18:07 EDT)" skipped: maximum number of running instances reached (1)
> ```

> This is due to we set the apscheduler to run the fetching code every 1 second, but it actually need more than 1 second to run. So it's basically a network issue. 

5. Reading data from terminal
After starting the `data-producer.py` program, we could use following command in terminal to read it.

This is the command for older version of Kafka
```
kafka-console-consumer.sh localhost:9092 --topic stock-price --from-beginning --zookeeper localhost:2181
```

This is the command for newer version of Kafka
```
 3184  ./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic stock-price --from-beginning
```

*** 

## Run the `data-storage.py` code

1. Set up Kafka, Zookeeper and Zipkin as mentioned above. 

2. Set up a Cassandra server in docker container

```
docker run -d -p 7199:7199 -p 9042:9042 -p 7001:7001 --name cassandra cassandra:3.10
```

3. Now we could run `data-producer.py` to generate data, while using `data-storage.py` to consume the date at the same time. 

```
python data-producer.py AAPL stock-analyzer localhost:9092
python data-storage.py stock-analyzer localhost:9092 localhost bittiger stock
```
